# Structure

As most Vue/Gridsome projects, all the individal webpages live in `src/pages/`, with supporting components and data in the `src/` directory.

However, all the changable data the site displays lives in `content/` as markdown files that are manipulated by Netlify's CMS page. Changing any displayed data should be done here, while any aesthetic/webpage changes should be made in `src/`.

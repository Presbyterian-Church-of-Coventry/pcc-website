**March 24-26, 2023** (Dinner Friday evening through worship on Sunday)

**Location: Pilgrim Pines Retreat and Conference Center, Swanzey, NH** 

Save the date men! Old and young. We will be joining the Pilgrim Pines men’s retreat for a weekend of building community. The men who attended last year found it very rewarding. There is always plenty of good food and time for fellowship. Saturday provides for some free time in the afternoon. There are plenty of options. One will be a hike of Mt. Monadnock led by Mark Franson. The lakeshore setting is beautiful and peaceful. Often there are loons and sometimes a bald eagle. Make it a priority. Unplug and prepare for conversation with other men – about guy-stuff. Plenty of unstructured time. See you there!

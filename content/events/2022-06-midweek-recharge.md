We are heading into Year 2 of the revamped Midweek Recharge ministry! From 6:00-7:00 PM food will be provided and individuals and families may come at any time during that hour to eat and spend time together. Beginning at 7:00 PM the focus will shift to a time of prayer, facilitated by an Elder, Pastor, or other servant-leader in the church. This is an opportunity for prayer, fellowship, and to invite others outside of PCC to come and enjoy a meal and spend time together.

Along with food, fellowship, and prayer, a kids bible club led by Mark Popovitch will also be available for children grades K-5th. Kids club will begin at 7:00 PM and is a ministry that provides opportunity for young people to grow in friendship with other children, receive instruction and lessons from Godâ€™s Word, and enjoy singing praise to the Lord.

During the months of July and August, we will have Backyard Fellowships in place of our regular Sunday evening service. We will gather at 5:30 PM at a host home for a time of food & fellowship, devotion, singing and prayer.

Each individual or family should bring chairs or blankets, meat to grill for their own family, and a side dish and/or dessert to share. All plates, utensils, and drinks will be provided. The rain location is the church. Please plan to make these gatherings a part of your summer routine! It is a great way to get to know each other better in an informal setting. The first backyard fellowship will be July 7th. Please sign upon the clipboard on the back table in the Fellowship Hall if you would like to host!

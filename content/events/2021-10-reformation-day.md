On **Sunday, October 30th at 6:00pm** we will be hosting a joint service with some of our sister churches in worship of our great and glorious God and in celebration of our protestant reformation heritage. We encourage you to come and worship our glorious God, fellowship with other brothers and sisters in Christ, and celebrate the fruits of the reformation!

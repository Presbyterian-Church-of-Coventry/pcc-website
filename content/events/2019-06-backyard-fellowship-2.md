During the months of July and August, we will have Backyard Fellowships in place of our regular Sunday evening service. We will gather at 5:30 PM at a host home for a time of food & fellowship, devotion, singing and prayer.

Each individual or family should bring chairs or blankets, meat to grill for their own family, and a side dish and/or dessert to share. All plates, utensils, and drinks will be provided. The rain location is the church. Please plan to make these gatherings a part of your summer routine! It is a great way to get to know each other better in an informal setting.

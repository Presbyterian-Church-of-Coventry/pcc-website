For those interested in learning more about the ministry of the Presbyterian Church of Coventry. This class runs for 8 weeks and takes place during the Sunday school hour (9:30-10:15). It focuses on understanding the gospel message, the doctrinal distinctives within PCC, and the ministries of our church. It is a time to grow in fellowship and understanding and provides a helpful avenue for those considering church membership. For those interested please contact Pastor Will (pastorjws@gmail.com) or the church office.

All are invited to attend our annual Family Thanksgiving Service on **Sunday, November 24th at 6:00 PM**. We will gather in the Sanctuary for a time of singing and giving thanks for Godâ€™s faithfulness over the past year.

We will then have a time of fellowship and eating of pies! Please plan to come and enjoy this wonderful church family event. Look for a sign-up sheet soon in the Fellowship Hall to sign up for pies, drinks, setup, and clean-up.

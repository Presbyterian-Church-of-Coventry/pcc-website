Pastor Bill is uncovering his grill after a long-winter's nap (the grill, not Bill), and he and Cecilia would love for you to come and enjoy some good food with them here at the church on Memorial Day Afternoon!

They will have smoked pork and turkey breast along with fixin's and drinks. If you are able they ask that you bring a snack, side, or dessert to share.

Come around **4:00 PM for fun and games, and we'll plan to dine around 5:00PM**.

Please contact Cecilia (via email or phone) with:

1. The numbre and ages in your group (feel free to bring friends and family along!)
2. The type of smoked meat you prefer.

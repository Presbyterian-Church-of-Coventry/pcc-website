We will be welcoming back our college students with encouragement & love after the worship service.

There will be medals for the three favorite pots as well as one for the first empty pot. (For those who miss the old chili cook-off, you are more than welcome to make chili as your cook-off entry). If youâ€™d like to participate please add your name to the sign-up sheet on the back table of the Fellowship Hall. We hope you can join us for some delicious food and fellowship!

_“True to the Scriptures, the Reformed Faith and obedient to the Great Commission.”_

# Who We Are

For the glory of God and the joy of his people PCC is a church devoted to biblical worship, reformed theology, the fellowship of the saints, and the advancement of gospel of Christ.

# What We Believe

We believe the Bible to be the inspired and inerrant Word of God and rule for faith and practice.

The Presbyterian Church of Coventry seeks to glorify and enjoy God through:

- God-centered worship that edifies disciples.
- Bible-centered Christian education that equips disciples.
- Grace-centered Covenant Community that encourages and equips disciples.
- Gospel missions locally and to the world that challenge and send disciples.

We also believe the [Westminster Confession and Catechisms](http://www.pcaac.org/resources/wcf/) to be an accurate, faithful, and edifying representation of what the Bible teaches.

# A Brief History

The congregation gathered in 1973 under the leadership of our founding pastor, Rev. Richard Gray. For the next six years, we met in Coventry Grammar School. We built and then moved into the current facility on Hwy. 44 and Trowbridge Road in 1979. Rev. Brad Evans was called to be the pastor in 1980. The building was enlarged in 1984 to add Sunday School space. A new sanctuary was added in 2003 which allows for the congregation to worship together in one service.

# Ministries, Events, and Activities

We have a broad range of activities for men, women, youth, and children. These activities range from weekend retreats and fellowship outings to a solid Christian education program. We also try to make a special effort to minister to families as a whole. One of the hallmark ministries of the church has been the Vacation Bible School program, which garners excellent support from the congregation and solid attendance and enthusiasm from children in the area.

_The Presbyterian Church of Coventry aspires to be a vibrant Christian community, centered on the worship of God and the fellowship of the saints, and bearing witness to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ._

# Biblical

We believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be the inspired Word of God and authoritative in all matters of faith and practice. The Bible is a complete and unified witness to God’s redemptive acts, culminating in the incarnation of the Living Word, the Lord Jesus Christ.

# Reformed

We joyfully embrace the Reformed tradition as expressed in the [Westminster Confession of Faith](http://www.pcaac.org/resources/wcf/). While we share the historical truths reflected in the Apostle’s and Nicene Creeds in common with all Christians, we believe the distinctives of Reformed theology best represent the truths of biblical Christianity.

# Missional

We are a community of disciples sent on mission. In our homes, communities, nation, and world, we desire to proclaim the gospel of Christ for the salvation of souls, the strength of the church, and the preservation of godliness in culture.

# Presbyterian

We are a congregation governed by elders. The word _Presbyterian_ comes from the Greek word meaning _elder_. In reflecting the teaching of scripture ([Titus 1:5](https://biblia.com/books/esv/Tt1.5); [1 Timothy 3:1-7](https://biblia.com/books/esv/1Ti3.1-7)), our elders seek to care for the congregation through shepherding, servant-leadership, and instruction in the Word of God.

The Discovery Class is for visitors and inquirers who are interested in learning more about The Presbyterian Church of Coventry (PCC). What is the gospel? What is our mission? What are the core doctrines and beliefs? How do people connect with other believers in fellowship? What are the ministries at PCC for children, youth, and adults? These and related questions are the primary focus of the Discovery Class. Led by Pastor Will Snyder, the class is 8 weeks long, takes place during the Sunday School hour (9:30-10:15), and is offered at various times throughout the year. For those interested please contact the church office: 860.742.7222.

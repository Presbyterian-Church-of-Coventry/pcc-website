The book of Daniel is one for our times. Though pressured by a godless culture, Daniel reminds the believer that he has nothing to fear when it is the fear of the Lord that animates the heart. Daniel’s bold courage points God’s people to the Lord Jesus Christ who entered the exile of the cross to bear their sin and receive them into the eternal kingdom of the Lord.

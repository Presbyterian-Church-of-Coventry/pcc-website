The four gospels are individual accounts of the life of Jesus written by either by his contemporaries, collecting together their own eye-witness testimony with that of others that they knew and trusted. When John Mark wrote his gospel, there was no previous example of what should be included or what its emphasis should be. Throughout Mark's account one theme stands out, that Jesus was no ordinary human being, but the very Son of God. Using a quick-moving narrative style, Mark leads us through the things Jesus did and taught, so that we can see for ourselves what led his disciples to believe in him, and be persuaded of these same things ourselves.

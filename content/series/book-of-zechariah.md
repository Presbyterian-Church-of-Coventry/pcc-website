Beginnings can be hard, and renewal can be even harder. The book of Zechariah is about just that -- a new beginning and a time of renewal for the people of God. The book is filled with vivid images and powerful visions. And within the words are some of the most memorable passages in all of the Old Testament, passages that paint pictures and provide truth for a people -- like us -- who find themselves discouraged by the problems within their culture and nation, and who feel a struggle amidst the larger geographical tensions around them.

The gospel of Matthew contains some of the most well-known verses in all of scripture— “come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men” (4:19), “blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven” (5:3), “Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations…” (28:19). In this series in Matthew’s gospel we learn from Christ as he instructs his disciples in the _kingdom of heaven_—learning to yield to his Lordship as committed disciples, and finding assurance of salvation in his cross and resurrection.

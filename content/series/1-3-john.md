The Epistles of John are wonderful books which focus on the theme of love and assurance—the love of God, the love that believers are called to have for one another, and the assurance of salvation for everyone who truly believes in the Lord Jesus Christ. In a world that is full of disordered and distorted versions of love, God’s Word through the Apostle John brings wonderful clarity.

We are all on a path. Everyone is going somewhere. And the book of Proverbs gives us a vision to the path of life and death. The image of two paths reminds us of the opening pages of Genesis, where God creates a garden and places before Adam and Eve two trees, “the tree of life” representing the wise path that leads to life and fellowship with God, and “the tree of knowledge” representing the foolish path that leads to death. In the garden we hear two voices, the voice and wisdom of God and the deceptive voice of the serpent. In Proverbs we are presented with two ways to live—the way of wisdom and the way of folly. Ultimately, the wisdom of Proverbs points us to the all-wise God revealed in the wonderful counselor, Jesus Christ. As the Apostle Paul said, in Christ “are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Col.2:3). In the book of Proverbs we have Christ himself coming to his people as their wise sage and wonderful counselor. Indeed, he is the competent counselor for our times.

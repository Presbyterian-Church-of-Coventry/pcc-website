As Christmas approaches, we consider the joyfulness of Christ’s entrance into this world through the eyes of Luke. Focusing on the four songs of Luke—_Mary’s Magnificat, Zechariah's Song, The Angel's Praise to the Shepherd's, and Simeon's Psalm of Worship_, we find expressed the great biblical themes of Christ’s incarnation, the coming salvation found in the Lord Jesus, and the reception of God’s gift in Christ.

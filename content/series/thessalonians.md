Paul’s letters to the church in Thessalonica are filled with hope and encouragement. Not only did Paul, along with Silas and Timothy help to plant and establish the church (see Acts 17), but these believers were sincerely growing in Christ despite suffering and affliction. Paul expresses his great thanks for their “work of faith, labor of love, and steadfastness of hope” (1 Thess.1:3). Additionally, these believers received the Word of God, which Paul and his companions preached to them, not as words of men, but as the Word of God (1 Thess.2:13). These letters provide an example of what sincere faith looks like, especially in the face of opposition and personal trials. And they also provide great hope, as the second coming of Christ is a central theme that runs throughout them. May the Lord encourage us and continue to shape the faith of his people through our study and application of these timeless letters.

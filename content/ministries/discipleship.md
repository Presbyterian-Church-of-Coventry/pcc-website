The Discipleship Group Ministry at PCC exists to bring glory to God and blessing to his people by helping one another grow in Jesus Christ. All of the 'one-another's in Scripture--Love one another, encourage one another, exhort one another, carry one another's burdens, exist to sanctify the believer in the Lord Jesus. Discipleship groups are one environment to help foster such sanctification.

The ministry consists of small groups in which men meet with men, and women meet with women. Groups meet in various places throughout the week and are focused on four main pillars: the Word of God, prayer, accountability, and service. They are aimed to provide spiritual nourishment through growing relationships in Christ Jesus. If you are interested in becoming a part of a discipleship group or starting a new one, please contact Pastor Will Snyder at the church office: (860) 742-7222.

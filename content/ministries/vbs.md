# Vacation Bible School

![VBS Wonder Junction](../images/vbs-wonder-junction.png)

**Dates:** Monday, August 4th – Friday, August 8nd, 2025, 9am-12pm

**Location:** Presbyterian Church of Coventry - 55 Trowbridge Rd, Coventry CT 06238

Please join The Presbyterian Church of Coventry for this week of fun featuring Bible lessons, crafts, games, music, and snacks!

This year, we'll travel to “**Wonder Junction**.” This VBS program is intended for children aged 4-12 years old. We'll learn about the life, ministry, death, resurrection, and impact of Jesus Christ on the world. We’ll **wonder** in His majesty and His works!

There is NO registration fee to attend Vacation Bible School.

Here are a few things to know before VBS kicks off:

- All children aged 4-12 are welcome to attend! Church membership is not necessary.
- All volunteers are trained and qualified with child safety being the utmost priority.
- Please wear sneakers for recreation.
- Each day, we'll collect a donation to support a missions project (either a missionary or a ministry), which we'll learn about throughout the week. Children are encouraged to bring coins to contribute to the donation; the coins really add up over the week!
- Parents, guardians, and siblings are invited to join us for our closing program on Friday, starting at 11:30. Afterwards, please join us for pizza, popsicles, and a time of fellowship (free of charge).

_To register, please fill out [our online form here](https://form.jotform.com/251183761252151)._

There is no deadline for registration. Families are strongly encouraged to register beforehand but can also register day-of.

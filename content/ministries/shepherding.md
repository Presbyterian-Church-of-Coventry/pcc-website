In seeking to reflect the teaching of Scripture, one of the ways the leadership at PCC seeks to serve the congregation is through a ministry of shepherding. In [1 Peter 5:1-3](https://www.esv.org/verses/1+Peter+5:1-3/), Peter writes,
_So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder…shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you…being examples to the flock._

With the goal of ministering to the whole congregation, each elder in the church oversees a shepherding group who meets once a month after worship. Enjoying fellowship and a meal together, praying for the ministry of the church, and growing together as the body of Christ, these shepherding groups seek to foster unity and love in Christ’s church.

If you are interested in participating in a shepherding group or desire to learn more about this ministry, we encourage you to speak with one of our Pastor’s or elders by calling the church office: (860) 742-7222

_How precious is your steadfast love, O God! The children of mankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings._ – [Psalm 36:7](https://www.esv.org/verses/Psalm+36:7/)

In the Children’s Ministry at the PCC, we serve to actively participate with the Lord in expanding his reign of grace in and through the lives of children, birth through 6th grade, and their families. We believe that parents can have the most significant impact on their children as they come to know God—loving Him with all their heart, soul, mind and strength—and learn to love their neighbors as themselves ([Matthew 22:37-40](https://www.esv.org/verses/Matthew+22:37-40/)). The Children’s Ministry seeks to partner with and strengthen the nurturing of faith within the context of the family.

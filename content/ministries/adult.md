The Adult Ministry at PCC exists to glorify God and extend His Kingdom by fostering growth in the body of Christ. Through Christian education, men’s and women’s retreats, and small group bible studies, we seek to build up adult believers who will be committed to knowing Christ and making him known.

The Apostle Paul wrote,
_Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ_ -[Colossians 1:28](https://www.esv.org/verses/Colossians+1:28/).
It is our desire to help cultivate maturity in the lives of God's people through Adult Ministries.

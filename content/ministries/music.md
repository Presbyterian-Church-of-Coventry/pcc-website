# Worship Orchestra

The worship orchestra provides music to aid in worship during the Sunday morning worship service. You do not need to be a professional musician to be a part of the orchestra and the music is available to download for those wanting to practice ahead of time. The orchestra meets at the front of the church on **Sunday mornings at 9:10 AM**. Please contact Bill Glenister if you wish to become a part of the orchestra. It is important that we know what instruments to expect, in order to have sheet music available.

# Adult Choir

The adult choir provides music during the offertory of the Sunday morning worship service. The adult choir meets in the sanctuary loft on **Sunday mornings at 8:40 AM**. We usually sing anthems twice each month. Those aged 12 and up who want to sing praise to the Lord are welcome. Contact Bill Glenister if you have any questions.

Soloists & Small Ensembles (Vocal & Instrumental): Volunteer basis. General need for monthly offertory.

RUF (Reformed University Fellowship) is a community on the UConn campus seeking to experience the gospel (the good news about Jesus Christ) in community with others, equip leaders for service on campus and in the world, and extend Godâ€™s work of changing lives, building community, healing our world, and renewing our culture.

The gospel of Jesus Christ is the heart of RUF. The gospel announces that by sheer grace God has broken into history in the person of Jesus Christ to restore us to himself and to renew the world He loves.
